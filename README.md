<h4 align="center">This is a chrome extension I developed after my partner showed me a nice website called Cooked.wiki it has an incredible feature that summarises a cooking recipe, and since me and my partner are everyday chefs (or try to be) I made this extension to make life easy for us, feel free to fork it, edit it or do whatever you want.</h4>

The extension has 2 key features, that you select from in the Popup.

Once you click the chrome extension you'll get prompted with 2 action types: Open new tab or Copy.
And at any point you find yourself in a cooking website, just click the extension and click "cook it".
